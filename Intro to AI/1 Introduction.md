# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

- Systems that think like humans
- Systems that act like humans
- Systems that think rationally
- Systems that act rationally

AI is the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.

### Acting humanly: The Turing Test Approach

- The Turing Test suggests that if an observer cannot distinguish between responses from a computer and a human, the computer could be considered intelligent.
- It evaluates behavior, without examining the AI's internal functioning or its scientific basis.
- This test has limitations in defining intelligence accurately.

### Thinking humanly: The Cognitive Modeling Approach

- Cognitive modeling aims to replicate human thinking in computers, drawing on the analogy that the brain functions like a computational device.
- This approach is foundational to cognitive science, emphasizing the simulation of human thought processes.

### Thinking rationally: The "Laws of Thought" Approach

- This approach posits that rational thinking involves following formal rules to manipulate symbols, drawing from logical principles.
- It views the mind as a computational device, contributing to the development of logic and rational thought.

### Acting rationally: The Rational Agent Approach

- Rational agents are designed to choose actions that maximize the achievement of goals, based on their perceptions.
- The focus is on achieving optimal outcomes, suggesting that rational actions are guided by the principle of maximizing utility.
