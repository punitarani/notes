# Regular Expressions

## Regular Language

A regular language is a language that can be **recognized by a finite automaton**.
A string is said to be in the language of a finite automaton if there exists a sequence of transitions from the initial state to a final state that corresponds to the string.

Regular languages have many properties, a few of them are:

- They are closed under concatenation, meaning that if two strings are in the language, then their concatenation is also in the language.
- They are closed under the Kleene star operation, meaning that the set of all strings obtained by concatenating zero or more copies of any string in the language is also in the language.
- They are closed under union and intersection.

Regular languages are a subset of the class of context-free languages and they are used in many fields such as compilers, lexical analysis, pattern matching, and data validation.

## Operations

### Union

$A \cup B = \{x | x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$

Union means that the language accepts any string that is accepted by either A or B.

Example: $A = {0, 1}$ and $B = {a, b, c}$

$A \cup B = \{0, 1, a, b, c\}$

### Concatenation

$A \circ B = \{x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\} = AB$

Concatenation means that the language accepts any string that is accepted by A followed by a string that is accepted by B.

Example: $A \circ B = \{0, 1\} \circ \{a, b, c\} = \{0a, 0b, 0c, 1a, 1b, 1c\}$

### Star (Kleene Closure)

$A^*= \{x \dots y | \text{ for each } x_i \in A \text{ for } k \ge 0\}$

Note: $\epsilon \in A^*$ always.

This operation is used to generate all possible strings that can be formed by concatenating zero or more copies of a given string from a regular language.

Example: $A^* = \{\epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, \dots\}$

## Closure Properties

### Closure under Union

Theorem: If $A$ and $B$ are regular languages, so is $A \cup B$.

Proof:

- Let $A$ and $B$ be regular languages.
- Let $M_a$ be a finite automaton that recognizes $A$
- Let $M_b$ be a finite automaton that recognizes $B$

Construct a new finite automaton $M$ that recognizes $A \cup B$:

- $Q = Q_a \times Q_b = \{(q_a, q_b) | q_a \in Q_a \text{ and } q_b \in Q_b\}$
- $q_0 = (q_a, q_b)$
- $\delta((q, r), a) = (\delta_a(q, a), \delta_b(r, a))$
- $F = (F_a \times Q_b) \cup (Q_a \times F_b)$

- The states of $M$ are the states of $M_a$ and $M_b$.
  - If $M_a$ has $k_a$ states and $M_b$ has $k_b$ states, then $M$ has $k_a + k_b$ states.

### Closure under Concatenation

Theorem: If $A$ and $B$ are regular languages, so is $A \circ B$.

The new machine $M$ will have the final states of $M_a$ directly connected to the initial states of $M_b$.
