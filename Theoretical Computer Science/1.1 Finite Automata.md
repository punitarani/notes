# Finite Automata

A finite automaton (FA) is a mathematical model of computation that consists of a finite set of states, an initial state, a set of final or accepting states, and a set of transition functions.
It is used to recognize patterns within input strings, and can be used to implement simple algorithms or solve problems in the theory of computation.
Finite automata are a fundamental concept in the theory of computation and are the basis for more complex models such as pushdown automata and Turing machines.

## Finite Automaton

A finite automaton (FA) is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) where:

1. Q is a finite set called the **states**
2. Σ is a finite set of input symbols called the **alphabet**
3. δ is a **transition function**. Q × Σ → Q is a mapping from a state and an input symbol to a state.
4. q0 ∈ Q is the **initial state**.
5. F ⊆ Q is a set of **final states** or **accepting states**

### Finite Automaton Representation

The state transitions can be represented in a table called a **transition table**.
It is a mapping from a state and an input symbol to a state.

For a given automaton $M = (Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F)$,
with $Q = \{q_1, q_2, q_3\}, $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$,

$\delta$ can be written as:

| q\*    | 0     | 1     |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| $q_1$  | $q_1$ | $q_2$ |
| $q_2$  | $q_3$ | $q_2$ |
| $q_3$  | $q_2$ | $q_2$ |

where $q_1$ is the start state
and $F = q_2$ is the final state.

#### Finite Automaton Set Notation

The transition function can also be written in set notation:

$\delta = \{((q_1, 0), q_1), ((q_1, 1), q_1), ((q_2, 0), q_3), ((q_2, 1), q_2), ((q_3, 0), q_2), ((q_3, 1), q_2)\}$
