# Hyperledger

Hyperledger is an open-source, collaborative platform for developing and deploying blockchain applications, primarily for use in enterprise settings.
It is governed by the Linux Foundation and provides a variety of tools and frameworks for building decentralized applications.
Some of the notable tools and frameworks in the Hyperledger ecosystem include Fabric, Sawtooth, Indy, Burrow, and Iroha.
These technologies offer features such as consensus algorithms, smart contract execution, digital identity management, and pluggable components for customization and integration with other technologies.
The goal of Hyperledger is to promote the use of blockchain technology in a variety of industries, with a focus on security, scalability, and privacy.

## Projects

- [Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric): A permissioned blockchain platform for developing and deploying decentralized applications (dapps).
  - It provides a modular architecture and pluggable components, allowing for customization and integration with other technologies.
  - Applications include supply chain management, digital identity, and asset management.
- [Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/sawtooth): A modular platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers.
  - It provides a modular architecture and pluggable components, allowing for customization and integration with other technologies.
  - It features consensus algorithms, multi-language support, and a unique, non-interactive consensus mechanism called "Proof of Elapsed Time." 
  - Applications include supply chain management, digital identity, asset management and voting systems.
- [Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu): Java-based, open-source blockchain client that is compatible with the Ethereum platform.
  - It provides a permissioned implementation of Ethereum, allowing for the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts on private or public networks.
  - Besu supports both Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms and provides features such as privacy, permissioning, network customization, and interoperability with other Ethereum tools and ecosystems.
  - Applications include supply chain management, digital identity, and financial services.
- [Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy): A decentralized identity platform for individuals, organizations, and devices.
  - It provides tools for creating self-sovereign identities and building decentralized identity applications.
  - Applications include identity verification, secure data sharing, and access control.
- [Iroha](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/iroha): A permissioned Ethereum smart contract interpreter.
  - It provides a consensus-driven blockchain for executing smart contracts, with a focus on enterprise use cases.
  - Applications include digital asset management and financial contract management.
- [Aries](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries): A decentralized identity platform for individuals, organizations, and devices.
  - It provides tools for creating self-sovereign identities and building decentralized identity applications.
  - Applications include identity verification, secure data sharing, and access control.

End-of-Life Projects

- [Burrow](https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/): A permissioned Ethereum smart contract interpreter.
  - It provides a consensus-driven blockchain for executing smart contracts, with a focus on enterprise use cases.
  - Applications include digital asset management and financial contract management.

Some other tools and frameworks in the Hyperledger ecosystem include:

- [AnonCreds](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/anoncreds): Hyperledger AnonCreds is a type of verifiable credential that supports important privacy-protecting capabilities based on zero-knowledge proof cryptography.
- [Bever](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/bevel): Hyperledger Bevel is an accelerator by which developers can consistently deploy production-ready distributed networks across public and private cloud providers.
- [Cacti](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/cacti): Hyperledger Cacti is a blockchain integration tool designed to allow users to securely integrate different blockchains.
- [Caliper](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/caliper): Hyperledger Caliper is a blockchain benchmark tool, it allows users to measure the performance of a blockchain implementation with a set of predefined use cases.
  - Hyperledger Caliper will produce reports containing a number of performance indicators to serve as a reference when using the following blockchain solutions: Besu, Ethereum, Fabric, FISCO BCOS, Iroha, and Sawtooth.
- [Cello](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/cello): Hyperledger Cello aims to serve as the operational dashboard for Blockchain, which reduces the effort required for creating, managing and using blockchains.
  - Besides, it can also be used to facilitate creating Blockchain as a Service.
  - Cello provides an operational console for managing blockchain’s efficiently and running on top of various infrastructures, e.g., bare-metal, virtual machine, and various container platforms.
- [Grid](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/grid): Hyperledger Grid intends to provide reference implementations of supply chain-centric data types, data models, and smart contract based business logic – all anchored on existing, open standards and industry best practices.
  - It showcases in authentic and practical ways how to combine components from the Hyperledger stack into a single, effective business solution.
- [Firefly](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/firefly): Hyperledger FireFly is the first open source Supernode, a complete stack for enterprises to build and scale secure Web3 applications.
  - The FireFly API for digital assets, data flows, and blockchain transactions makes it radically faster to build production-ready apps on popular chains and protocols.
- [Solang](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/solang): Hyperledger Solang is a Solidity compiler written in rust which uses llvm as the compiler backend.
  - Solang can compile Solidity for Solana and Substrate.
- [Transact](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/transact): Hyperledger Transact aims to reduce the development effort in writing distributed ledger software by providing a standard interface for executing smart contracts that is separate from the distributed ledger implementation.
  - Hyperledger Transact takes an extensible approach to implementing new smart contract languages called “smart contract engines,” that implement a virtual machine or interpreter that processes smart contracts.
- [Ursa](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa): Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and hopefully increase security in the process.
  - The library is an opt-in repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place and use crypto.
  - Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to cryptographic code.
