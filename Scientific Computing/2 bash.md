### Operating system

A collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.
The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system.

### Kernel

The core part of an operating system that controls all other parts of the system.
It is responsible for managing system resources such as memory, processors, and devices.
It also provides a communication interface between applications and hardware.

### Shell

A command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by typing commands.
It provides an interface to the kernel, allowing users to execute various tasks such as file management, process management, and system configuration.
Examples of shells include the Windows Command Prompt and the Unix/Linux Bash shell.

## Bash

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.
It is a command-line interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input device or from a file.
