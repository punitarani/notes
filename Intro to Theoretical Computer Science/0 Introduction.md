# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

## Fundamental Questions

- What are fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?
- What makes some problems hard and others easy?
- Can we systematically build machines that have proven characteristics?

Goal: Answer these questions in an abstract and general manner that is independent of the actual physical hardware for computation.

## Theory of Computation

The theory of computation is the study of algorithms, their efficiency, and the limits of their power.
It includes the study of computability, which deals with the question of what problems can be solved by algorithms, and complexity theory, which deals with the question of how efficiently problems can be solved.
The theory of computation also encompasses the study of various models of computation, such as Turing machines and the lambda calculus, which provide a formal framework for understanding the properties of algorithms and the limits of their power.

The three main areas of theory of computation are:

- **Automata Theory**: building abstract machines.
- **Computability Theory**: Fundamental capabilities and limitations of abstract machines.
- **Complexity Theory**: Why certain problems are harder than others.

## Automata Theory

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines that can be used to model computation.

An abstract machine is essentially a mathematical model of computation.
