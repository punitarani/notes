# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

## Fundamental Questions

- What are fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?
- What makes some problems hard and others easy?
- Can we systematically build machines that have proven characteristics?

Goal: Answer these questions in an abstract and general manner that is independent of the actual physical hardware for computation.
