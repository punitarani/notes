## XML

- XML stands for Extensible Markup Language that is used to store and transport data.
- It is used for defining data types and for exchanging data between applications.
- It is similar to HTML but has no predefined tags and is more flexible.
- Some common languages and protocols that use XML are:
  - BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)
  - RDF (Resource Description Framework)
  - OWL (Ontology Web Language)
  - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  - WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
  - UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)
- XML definition rules
  - Case sensitive
  - Opening and closing tags must match
  - Documents must have a root element
  - Documents are recommended to have an XML declaration
