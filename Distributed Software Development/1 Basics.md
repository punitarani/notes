# Distributed Computing Basics

## 2-Tiered Architecture

- This is a classic client-server system.
- It is modelled as a set of services provided by the servers and a set of clients.
- Clients know Servers but Servers may not know Clients.
- Clients and Servers are logical processes: they could reside on different or same processors.
