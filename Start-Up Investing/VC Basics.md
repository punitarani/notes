### Example Fund Structure

- $100M Fund
- Management Fee - 2% per year
    - $2M per year
- Capital Call - quarterly at 10-15% of the committed capital
    - $10M-$15M per year
    - This is the amount that the limited partners are required to contribute to the fund within a specified period of time.
- Multiples of Invested Capital
    - 3x return on the invested capital
    - Fund value - $300M
- Carried Interest - 20%
    - Profit = $300M - $100M = $200M
    - Carried Interest = 20% of $200M = $40M for the general partners
    - Limited Partners = $160M
