# Linux commands

## `ls`

`ls` is a command used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to list the contents of a directory.
When run without any arguments, `ls` will list the files and directories in the current working directory.

Here are some common usage examples:

- `ls` - lists the files and directories in the current directory
- `ls -l` - lists the files and directories in a "long" format, including details such as file permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- l`s -a` - lists all files and directories, including hidden files and directories (those that begin with a dot ".")
- `ls -la` - combines the -l and -a options, showing a long listing of all files and directories
- l`s dirname` - lists the contents of the specified directory "dirname"
- `ls file1 file2` - lists information about the specified files "file1" and "file2"

The ls command has many options, some of them are:

- `-a`, --all
- `-d`, --directory
- `-h`, --human-readable
- `-l`, --long format
- `-r`, --reverse
- `-R,` --recursive
- `-t`, --sort-by-time
