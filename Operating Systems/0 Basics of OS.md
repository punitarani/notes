# Basics of Operating Systems

## Operating System

An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
It is the primary interface between a human and a computer.

### Responsibilities

- **Process Management**: Schedule programs for execution and coordinate their execution.
- **Job Management**: Manage the execution of jobs and the allocation of resources to jobs.
- **Device Management**: Managing connected devices, peripherals and their drivers.
- **File Management**: Manage files and directories.
- **Memory Management**: Manage memory allocation and deallocation and memory protection for processes.

## Processing

Processing is the execution of a program by a computer.

### Batch Processing

Jobs are queued, executed and results rendered.
Batch processing is essentially a series of scheduled programs that require no external influence.

### Interactive Processing

Programs with Input and Output.
Many programs are interactive in nature.
Interactive programs require some for of user interaction to accomplish goals that the user sets forth.

### Multiprocessing/Multithreading

Multiple processes working with shared data.
It allows multiple programs to run simultaneously to increase the overall efficiency of the system.
This can lead to problems from concurrency errors to race conditions and deadlocks.
