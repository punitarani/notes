## General

- **Computer Architecture**: Hardware - Operating System - Application Programs - User Instructions
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU Time, Memory Allocation, Storage, and I/O Devices.
- **Operating System**: Centralized Software Architecture responsible for computer's functionalities:
  - Scheduling Tasks
  - Executing Application
  - Controlling Peripherals
  - Managing Memory and CPU Processing
  - Storage Management and Data Handling
  - Network Management
- **OS Objectives**: Resource Efficiency (Virtualization), Ease of Use, and Reliability (Security).
- **Computer System Organization**: Bus, Interrupts, Storage Structure, I/O Structure.
