# Disjoint Sets

A Disjoint Set maintains a collection (set) of disjoint dynamic (sub) sets.
$S={S_1, S_2, \dots , S_k}$

- Each element could be a pointer to an object
- **Representative**: One element of a set that is used to identify the entire set.
  - Similar to root of a tree or head of a linked list
